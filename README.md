# Template for quickly setting up go SSR site with echo and goview

## Featuring
- Echo framework
- Goview to help with templating
- GORM with Postgges
- Session authentication

## TODOs:
- [] Link all of the libraries in "featuring" section
- [] Actually setup the rootSitePath
- [] Setup a good way to serve static content such as libraries
- [] Maybe think about setting up some theme or CSS library?
- [] Maybe find an actual way to load up the .env file in the dev_run.sh
- [] Make some CLI or script for easy deployment of this Template
  - Not much needed other then copying the folder then using `sed -i` to replace the name to the desired one
- [] Look more at making a dev container
  - Maybe there's some easy way to make it portable across x86 and arm
