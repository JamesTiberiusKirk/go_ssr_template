# SPA
- This package is meant to make it a bit easier to just setup a quick spa web app
- Realistically speaking it should not matter what framework is used 

## Fields
- `MenuID` is used to get the route for the `routes` map used by templating
- `Path` is the path it will be served on
- `Dist` is the build path for the bundled assets (build folder for the framework)
- `Index` is for specifying the `index.html`
- `Routing` is for specifying weather the SPA will perform it's own routing 
  - With something like react router dom

## This specific example with React
- Feel free to nuke this example and create your own with your own javascript framework setup
- The following react hello world was generated by `create-react-app`
```sh
npx create-react-app react_portal --template typescript
```
- In order to get the react app to work in with the sub route defined by the `Site` struct I had to add the sub route to the `package.json`
```json
{
  ...
  "homepage": "portal/.",
  ...
}
```
- In order to use react router dom, use the basename attribute when declaring the component

### To replace this example
- Remove the `react_portal` folder
- Create your on `spa.Site` instance following the `NewReactPortal` example in `react_portal_example.go`
- Remove `react_portal_example.go` file

## To remove the SPA feature
- Remove the `spa` package
- Remove the `Site.mapSpaSites` function declaration and call from the `site/site.go` file
