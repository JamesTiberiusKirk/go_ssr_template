# Pages package
- This package is all about managing templates and server side rendering
- By far this is the most complex thing here
- But just like anything else in this template, feel free to remove and cleanup anything you might not need
- There are two main struct that are used through this feature
  - `Page` for defining an actual page
  - `PageMetaData` is for defining data which will be passed to every single page on the site such as title, menu id and commonly used url variables

## Page fields
- `MenuID` aka a page id is injected into each page meta PageMetaData
  - Also used in the routes map which is accessible in all of the templates so you don't need to hard code any urls in the templates 
  - Keep it camel case if u want to be able to use the [routes](#templating) value in the template without needing to use the `index` function 
- `Frame` used to define whether the page is to be encapsulated by the normal page frame defined in `Site`
- `Template` is to define the file used as the main template of the page
  -  File path will be relative to the folder containing the templates defined in  the `Site.buildRenderer` function
- `Deps` is to hold any page specific dependencies
- `GetPageData` is a function which will get any page data needed then have it embedded in the page templating system
- Handlers for POST, DELETE, and PUT are also present if there is a need to add those handlers for a specific page.
  - E.G. if there is a form on the page, etc...


## Templating
- Renderer built in functions:
  - `include` this is to just include extra templates
  - `includeJs` use this to include a js file, it will automatically wrap script tags around the file contents
  - `includeTs` same as the above, however it prepends the output folder for any compiled typescript and replaces `.ts` with `.js`
- Template variables:
  - `data` will be whatever the `Page.GetPageData` function returns for each page
  - `meta` is generated by `Page.buildBasePageMetaData` function and it returns an instance of `PageMetaData`
  - `auth` will either be empty or will contain the email and username of the currently logged in user
  - `routes` will be `map[string]map[string]`
    - Allowing you to write something similar to the following `{{.routes.site.userPage}}` and get the url that is defined for that page.
    - This also works with the api package, i.e. `{{.routes.api.helloWorld}}`
